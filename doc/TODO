	Who needs a separate backend? Just integrate any relevant options in the main

	Not seperate but I still have to figure out how to have to have content
	presented, lol.	I don't want to scare Myra away with the control panel,
	so I'll have to figure out howto make it seem less menacing. Not sure how much
	to include on pages.

* Teach Faore how to login with a test account (Adalind)
	I'm probably just doing something stupid but after running bundle exec rake
	db:migrate:auto, I still can't login.  From looking at the Rakefile,
	u = create(:user, login: "user", password: "password", email:
	"me@mkaito.com"), I'm guessing should be able to login as 'user' with
	'password'. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

	bundle exec rake db:seed is the task you're looking for. It takes a while to
	populate the database. Along the lines of 5-7 minutes on my machine
