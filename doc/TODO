	I'm probably just doing something stupid but after running bundle exec rake db:migrate:auto, I still can't login.
	From looking at the Rakefile, u = create(:user, login: "user", password: "password", email: "me@mkaito.com"),
	I'm guessing should be able to login as 'user' with 'password'. But that doesn't seem to be the case.
