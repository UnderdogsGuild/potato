* Research searching (what?) (Adalind)

* !! Design navbar-flip content dropdown for logged in users (Faore) [In Progress]

* Clean up Post view (Faore)

* !! Add missing options to forum view (Faore)

* !! Hide certain options from the navbar (Faore)

* Rework the cog menu (Faore)

* Consider and work on design for a backend (Faore)
	mkaito:
		Who needs a separate backend? Just integrate any relevant options in the
		main interface via permission checks.

	Faore:
		Not seperate but I still have to figure out how to have to have content
		presented, lol.	I don't want to scare Myra away with the control panel, so
		I'll have to figure out howto make it seem less menacing. Not sure how much
		to include on pages.

	mkaito:
		It's a lot less menacing to edit things in-place instead of at a special
		page for admins

* Modify mobile nav to be consistent with all the changes above, and fix its
  broken icon (Faore)

* Learn some JQuery AJAX/JSON skills and apply them to make additional posts
  and threads appear on their pages (Faore)

* Hash passwords before form submission (Faore)
	mkaito:
		What bitlength should we use for SHA2? Here are to reference
		implementations in Javascript, one for 256 bits, and one for 512 bits. Both
		are reasonably fast, and Ruby supports both. All other things equal, how
		about we just go for the higher one?

		http://www.happycode.info/javascript-sha-512/

		Alternatively, check out this JS library that supports all SHA algos:
		https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA

		I'd like to propose adding a password guideline where appropiate, as little
		help blurb. I want it to literally say "whatever you want", and show
		a tooltip on hover that shows some examples with crazy shit like control
		characters, chinese characters, and all that stuff that most sites would
		bark at you for.
