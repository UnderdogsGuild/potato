	mkaito:
		Who needs a separate backend? Just integrate any relevant options in the
		main interface via permission checks.

	Faore:
		Not seperate but I still have to figure out how to have to have content
		presented, lol.	I don't want to scare Myra away with the control panel, so
		I'll have to figure out howto make it seem less menacing. Not sure how much
		to include on pages.

	mkaito:
		It's a lot less menacing to edit things in-place instead of at a special
		page for admins
