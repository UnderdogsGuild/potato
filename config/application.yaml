Production values are read from execution environment, to avoid placing
production credentials in version history.

The database configurator looks for the following environment variables:
DB_ADAPTER, DB_PATH, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE

but only if it finds DB_ADAPTER first

Example for mysql:
DB_ADAPTER="mysql"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_USER="mysqluser"
DB_PASSWORD="mysqlpassword"
DB_DATABASE="awesomedb"
